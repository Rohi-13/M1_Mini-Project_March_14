# Requirements
## Introduction
This document aims at defining overall software requirement for STUDENT RECORD SYSTEM .Efforts have been made to define the
requirements exhaustively and accurately. The final product will be having only
features/functionalities mentioned in this document and assumptions for any
additional functionality/feature should not be made by any of the parties involved
in developing/testing/implementing /using this product .
* The objective of Student Record System is to allow the administrator of
any organization to edit and find out the personal details of a student and
allows the student to keep up to date his profile .It’ll also facilitate keeping all
the records of students, such as their name, address,Branch,Percentage etc. So all the information about an student will be available in a
few seconds.
Overall, it’ll make Student Record system an easier job for the
administrator and the student of any organization.
The main purpose of this SRS document is to illustrate the requirements of
the project Student information System and is intended to help any
organization to maintain and manage its student’s personal data.

* Functional Requirements :
1. The Administrator will be given more powers (enable/disable/ update) than
 other users.
2. It will be ensured that the information entered is of the correct format. For
example name cannot contain numbers. In case if incorrect form of
information is added, the user will be asked to fill the information again.
3. The system can be accessed anytime.


* Non- Functional Requirement :
 1. Performance Requirements:
 The proposed system that we are going to develop will be used as the
Chief performance system for providing help to the organization in
managing the whole database of the student studying in the organisation.
Therefore, it is expected that the database would perform functionally all
the requirements that are specified.
 2. Safety Requirements:
The database may get crashed at any certain time due to virus or operating
system failure. Therefore, it is required to take the database backup.
 3. Security Requirements:
We are going to develop a secured database. There are different
categories of users namely Administartor ,Student who will be viewing
either all or some specific information form the database.
Depending upon the category of user the access rights are decided. It
means if the user is an administrator then he can be able to modify the
data, append etc. All other users only have the rights to retrieve the
information about database.
## STUDENT RECORD SYSTEM Build With C Programming Language
